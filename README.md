> **Note:** This extension requires the [GIFT Format Extension](https://github.com/ethan-ou/vscode-gift). We recommend installing the [GIFT Format Pack](https://github.com/ethan-ou/vscode-gift-pack) which bundles both this extension and language support for the GIFT Format.

This extension provides a live preview for Moodle's GIFT format. Using this extension, you can write questions in GIFT while viewing the result in a modified version of Moodle's default theme.

Once installed, preview your questions by right-clicking on a GIFT file in Visual Studio Code, then selecting `Open Preview to the Side`. Alternatively, press `CTRL + K` followed by `M` on your keyboard.

## Getting Started

To install the plugin, we'll first need to install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Visual Studio Code is an open-source text editor for Windows, macOS and Linux, with powerful features for working with programming languages.

To install Visual Studio Code:

1. Download the installation file from the [Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. Install the program.

If you're having trouble with installation, you can consult the [Visual Studio Code documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview).

## Installation

Once Visual Studio Code is installed, you can add the extension through the Extension Marketplace.

For the majority of users, we recommend installing this extension through the [GIFT Language Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ethan-ou.vscode-gift-pack), which includes language support for the GIFT format.

To install the GIFT Language Pack:

1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. Follow [this link to the GIFT Language Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ethan-ou.vscode-gift-pack) and click the `Install` button.
3. When prompted, allow your browser to open Visual Studio Code.
4. The extension should now be installing in your editor.

## Using the Plugin

After installing, open a GIFT file or switch VSCode to the GIFT format. Then, right click and select `Open Preview to the Side`. Alternatively, press `CTRL + K` followed by `M` on your keyboard.

The extension features two screens: a snippet reference screen and the preview screen. You can access the snippet reference at any time by going to the button at the bottom right labelled `View Snippets...`.

## Credits

This extension builds on the work of [fuhrmanator](https://github.com/fuhrmanator/GIFT-grammar-PEG.js) and is a fork of [tht13's html-preview-vscode](https://github.com/tht13/html-preview-vscode).
